# PascalsTriangle
Print a space delimited string of Pascals Triangle of depth n

This program was written in a single file to fulfill the requirements
of an assessment problem.

Instructions

Compile and execute main.cpp. The program will wait for user input of
positive integers to the command line. Given a positive integer, the
program prints a string of pascals triangle using a depth of the input.

User may input "exit" to exit the program.

The program may become unresponsive if given large depths (>1000).

Algorithm could be simplified by printing the tree bottom up, instead of calculating the numbers of a given line by brute force calculating the numbers of all parent lines
